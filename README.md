# image_representaion
Project on image representation with implementaion of 3 methods:

a) Hybrid Images:
--> Composite images made using high and low spacial frequencies from 2 separate images. Creates an optical illusion of seeing the two different images based upon the viewing distance.

b) Image Pyramids:
--> Multi-scale representation of an image using subsampling and smoothing.

c) Edge Detection:
--> Implemetaions of a simple gradient-based edge detector and edge detection using a set of oriented filters.
