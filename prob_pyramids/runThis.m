function [G, L] = pyramidsGL(im, N)
% [G, L] = pyramidsGL(im, N)
% Creates Gaussian (G) and Laplacian (L) pyramids of level N from image im.
% G and L are cell where G{i}, L{i} stores the i-th level of Gaussian and Laplacian pyramid, respectively.

% Remove the high frequencies from image1 by blurring it. The amount of
% blur that works best will vary with different image pairs

%low_frequencies = 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Remove the low frequencies from image2. The easiest way to do this is to
% subtract a blurred version of image2 from the original version of image2.
% This will give you an image centered at zero with negative values.

%high_frequencies =

% Combine the high frequencies and low frequencies
